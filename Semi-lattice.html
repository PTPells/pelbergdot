    <h3>
      Semi-lattices and side projects
    </h3>
    <h4>
      A couple of years ago, I designed a free-standing kitchen island/countertop for our apartment. We had the island made from a ~3" thick, 75" long piece of recycled eucalyptus butcher block.
      <br>The block needed to be cut down some to meet our needs and the offcuts ended up being large enough to make four cutting boards.<br>
      <br>I imagined the process for making the first cutting board would be straightforward considering the planks had already been glued-up and planed. I would need to fill in the imperfections, sand the block to 220 grit, chamfer the edges, moisturize it with mineral oil, and seal it with beeswax. These were all operations I had experience with or could clearly visualize, except for the “fill in the imperfections” part.<br>
      <br>In any case, I did the filling-in, sanding, chamfering, moisturizing, and sealing. I did not encounter any issues in the process. Then, when I went to rinse the board off after using it for the first time, I noticed an off-white substance running off the board into the sink. I pieced together that this was the wood glue + sawdust combination I'd used to fill in the board’s imperfections. I came to understand wood glue is water soluble; the cutting board was not usable in its current form.<br>
      <br>This information was new and inconvenient. I lost enthusiasm for the project soon after.<br>
      <br>Meanwhile, we moved into a new apartment and needed more counter space in the kitchen for our coffee set up. The Ikea Bror cart fit the space well and I planned to replace its plywood top with something that would soften the cart’s industrial powder-coated steel frame and compliment its heft. I found a slab of sycamore I thought would work well and I proceeded to finish it.<br>
      <br>Before sanding the sycamore slab, I needed to fill in a few places where the wood had partially split. The same problem as before, but this time, I used epoxy. The epoxy worked well and I became comfortable working with it.<br>
      <br>While working on the coffee cart, Sara wanted to go to Urban Ore. There, I found a solid, albeit rusty, Stanley Chisel. I figured some steel wool, rust remover, and a whetstone could bring it back into a usable state. This worked, and in the process, it occurred to me that I could use the now-functional chisel to excavate the hardened wood glue and sawdust from the cutting board that had been sitting for 6+ months. I also had epoxy left over from the sycamore slab. These new tools – the epoxy and the chisel – and the know-how to use them, summed into the motivation and resources I needed to finish the cutting board, which I ended up doing.<br>
      <br>We’ve been using the cutting board and coffee cart without issue for a few months now. Within this usage, and a reflection on the process of making these two pieces, is some information I would like to keep in mind when working on side projects going forward: projects relate in many ways and these relationships are difficult to see before starting.<br>
      <br>After learning the wood glue-sawdust mixture was not sufficient, I left the cutting board out in our living room as a reminder for me to continue working on it.<br>
      <br>After a couple of weekends passed without doing any additional work on the cutting board, I started to feel weighed down by its “unfinishedness.” I resisted starting work on other projects, not wanting to move onto a new one without having finished the previous one.<br>
      <br>Eventually, I got tired of looking at the cutting boards and I moved them to the closet. Sometime after, I started work on the coffee cart project and, well, we already went through this part of the story.<br>
      <br>Thinking back on all of this, I grew curious why I was unwilling to afford myself the space to subvert the sequence I had planned.<br>
