      <i>Spontaneous group chat, in an open network:</i><br>
      <i>Spring 2014 - Fall 2016</i>
    <h4>
      In 2014, many services offered real time chat (1:1 and group). However, they assumed you – the sender – knew who was interested in talking about the same thing you were, in the moment you were thinking it.<br>

      <br>And for the instances when the audience for your thought was not clear, there were a range of tools for broadcasting a piece of media, but none expressly designed to celebrate/foster the resulting conversation.<br>

      <br>On the continuum between directed messaging and broadcast publishing, we saw a space for a service for the moments when you wanted to talk about something specific, but were unclear who else felt similarly.

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <h4>
      Jot encouraged a vibrant community to emerge atop it. A community that policed itself without centralized enforcement, developed its own slang <!--<a title="Jotionary"href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M-bL63bZPx-GVDLIFywULPNZbSdBSg_qIA-SJKv4t5Y/edit">slang</a> --> and self-organized in person meetups in cities across the U.S. and Europe. A community whose intensity attracted – and led to us taking on – venture capital investment.<br>
