    <br><h3>Jot</h3>
    <h4><i>Spontaneous group chat, in an open network.</i></h4>
    <h4>
      In 2014, many services offered real time chat (1:1 and group). However, they assumed you – the sender – knew who was interested in talking about the same thing you were, in the moment you were thinking it.<br>

      <br>And for the instances when the audience for your thought was not clear, there were a range of tools for broadcasting a piece of media, but none expressly designed to celebrate/foster the resulting conversation.<br>

      <br>On the continuum between directed messaging and broadcast publishing, we saw a space for a service for the moments when you wanted to talk about something specific, but were unclear who else felt similarly.

    <!-- <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <h4>
      Jot encouraged a vibrant community to emerge atop it. A community that improvised its own slang (see the Jotionary), self-organized in person meetups in cities across the U.S. and Europe and formed enduring relationships. A community whose intensity attracted – and led to us taking on – venture capital investment<br>

      <br>However, Jot did not grow as quickly as we – at the time – thought it needed to. While peoples' use boosted our confidence in Jot's core interaction, we thought remixing the surrounding mechanics could encourage the kind of growth we were seeking. Chalk would become this exploration. -->
