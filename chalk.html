    <h3>Context</h3>
    <h4><a title="heychalk.com" href="https://www.heychalk.com/">Chalk</a> was <a title="caret-labs" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret">our</a> exploration into "unlocking" viral growth. We intended to preserve <a title="Jot" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/jot">Jot's,</a> core "spontaneous group chat" interaction, while remixing the surrounding mechanics to more clearly demonstrate to people why the service, and their experience with it, would be markedly better the more they brought their existing friends onto it.<h4>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <h4>
      The changes we made were effective at encouraging the kind of growth we sought. Chalk's 1 person, 1 chat room paradigm appealed to people with existing audiences. Specifically, <a title="@heychalk" href="https://www.instagram.com/heychalk/">teenage Instagram influencers</a> overwhelmed by DM requests from their followers to talk, but who lacked a space to do so at scale.<br>

      <br>In subsequent months, this niche of teen influencers helped drive Chalk to grow into a <!--<span style="background-color: #FFE8D0">top 100 app </span>--> top 100 app in the U.S. App Store (Social Networking).<h4>Chalk's growth, took us further down the "live streaming" path wherein we discovered the "live selling" <a title="wired" href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-live-qvc-pearl-parties/">behavior</a> that was emerging on Persicope and Facebook Live. The behavior that would become the basis for <a title="Baskets" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/baskets">Baskets</a>.

    <!-- <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <h4>
      Jot encouraged a vibrant community to emerge atop it. A community that improvised its own slang (see the Jotionary), self-organized in person meetups in cities across the U.S. and Europe and formed enduring relationships. A community whose intensity attracted – and led to us taking on – venture capital investment<br>

      <br>However, Jot did not grow as quickly as we – at the time – thought it needed to. While peoples' use boosted our confidence in Jot's core interaction, we thought remixing the surrounding mechanics could encourage the kind of growth we were seeking. Chalk would become this exploration. -->
