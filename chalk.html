    <h3>Where we started</h3>
    <h4><a title="heychalk.com" href="https://www.heychalk.com/">Chalk</a> was <a title="caret-labs" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret">our</a> exploration into "unlocking" viral growth. We intended to preserve <a title="Jot" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/jot">Jot's,</a> core "spontaneous group chat" interaction, while remixing the surrounding mechanics to more clearly demonstrate to people why their experience with the service would be markedly better, the more they brought their existing friends onto it <h4><br>

    <h3>Where we ended up</h3>
    <h4>
      The changes we made were effective at encouraging the kind of growth we sought. Chalk's "1 person, 1 chat room" paradigm appealed to people with existing audiences. Specifically, <a title="@heychalk" href="https://www.instagram.com/heychalk/">teenage Instagram influencers</a> overwhelmed by DM requests from their followers to talk, but who lacked a space to engage with everyone scale.<br>

      <br>In subsequent months, this niche of teen influencers helped drive Chalk to grow into a <!--<span style="background-color: #FFE8D0">top 100 app </span>--> top 100 app in the U.S. App Store (Social Networking) and to support 100,000s of daily interactions. <h4>On Chalk, we thought you should be able move fluidly between media types. It was during our exploration of what would become Chalk's live video feature that we discovered the "live selling" <a title="wired" href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-live-qvc-pearl-parties/">behavior</a> emerging on Persicope and Facebook Live. The behavior that would become the basis for <a title="Baskets" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/baskets">Baskets</a>.

    <!-- <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <h4>
      Jot encouraged a vibrant community to emerge atop it. A community that improvised its own slang (see the Jotionary), self-organized in person meetups in cities across the U.S. and Europe and formed enduring relationships. A community whose intensity attracted – and led to us taking on – venture capital investment<br>

      <br>However, Jot did not grow as quickly as we – at the time – thought it needed to. While peoples' use boosted our confidence in Jot's core interaction, we thought remixing the surrounding mechanics could encourage the kind of growth we were seeking. Chalk would become this exploration. -->
