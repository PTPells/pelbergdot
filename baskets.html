      <i>⇢ A shopping cart for Facebook Live</i><br>

    </h4>
    <h4>
      In fall 2016, we began designing the live video experience for <a title="Chalk" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/chalk">Chalk</a>. For the feature to succeed, we recognized it needed to be necessary and obviously different from the experience other services were offering.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      We approached the above by looking for an emerging live video behvaior <a title="Chalk" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/chalk">Chalk</a> could better serve. A behavior that was:
    </h4>
    <h4><ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><b>1/</b>  Growing</li>
      <li><b>2/</b>  Constrained by existing tools</li>
      <li><b>3/</b>  Likely to become mainstream if that constraint was lifted</li>
    </ul></h4>
    <h4>
      Of all the behaviors we noticed, <a title="Wired FB Live" href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-live-qvc-pearl-parties/">live selling</a> best met our criteria. These Periscope and Facebook Live sales were growing in frequency, viewership and revenue. All the while, the sales workflows the small businesses and collectors hosting them had improvised were breaking down.
    <h4>
      After a period of research, we shifted our attention to building Baskets as a standalone product. The tool would evolve into a real time sales dashboard for sellers to automatically track incoming orders and for viewers to receive purchase confirmation in-stream.
    </h4>
    <!-- <h3>
      Core Components
    </h3>
    <h4><ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>In-chat order updates</li>
      <li>Real time sales dashboard</li>
      <li>Comment ordering</li>
    </ul></h4>
  </h4><br> -->
    <h3>
      Outcome
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Baskets helped sellers multiply the revenue they were able to generate through Facebook Live sales and in the process, we built a modest amount of monthly recurring subscription revenue.
