    <h4><i>A shopping cart for Facebook Live</i></h4>
    <h4>
      In fall 2016, we began designing the live video experience for <a title="Chalk" href="http://pelberg.com/projects/caret/chalk">Chalk</a>. For the feature to succeed, we recognized it needed to be necessary and obviously different from the experience other services were offering.[1][2]
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Our approach to the above was to look for an emerging live video behvaior that was:
    </h4>
    <h4><ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><b>1_</b> Growing</li>
      <li><b>2_</b> Constrained by existing tools</li>
      <li><b>3_</b> Likely to become mainstream if that constraint was lifted</li>
    </ul></h4>
    <h4>
      Of all the behaviors we noticed, live selling best met our criteria. They were growing in frequency, viewership and revenue. All the while, the manual workflows the small businesses and collectors hosting these auctions and sales had improvised to track their sales and generate invoices were breaking down.
    <h4>
      We shifted our attention from Chalk to building a Baskets, a tool that integrated seamlessly with Facebook Live to track incoming orders, post real time updates for viewers to see and log the final sale details for each transaction.

    <h3>
      Core Components
    </h3>
    <h4><ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>In-chat order updates</li>
      <li>Real time sales dashboard</li>
      <li>Comment ordering</li>
    </ul></h4>
    </h4><br>
    <h3>
      Outcome
    </h3>
    <h4>
      All together, Baskets helped sellers generate $400,000+ in revenue through Facebook Live sales and built a modest amount of monthly recurring subscription revenue.
