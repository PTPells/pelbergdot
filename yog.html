    <br><h3>Yog</h3>
    <h4><i>Run virtually with anyone in the world in real time.</i></h4>
    <h4>
      By 2011, running with a phone was familiar. A range of apps offered runners the ability, to record and subsequently, analyze and socialize through the data they generated from their activities. This was great, assuming you'd already developed a running habit.
    </h4>
    <h4>
However, for people who hadn't started    running, but wanted to, having someone to run *with* was most effective at getting them there.
</h4>
    <h4>
      We designed Yog for this purpose. Yog matched runners from 103 countries and created an experience that simulated the running together in the same place.

    <h3>
      Core Components
    </h3>
    <h4><ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Real-time audio and visual cues</li>
      <li>Limited post-run data</li>
      <li>Pre-scheduled runs</li>
    </ul></h4>
    </h4><br>
    <h3>
      Outcome
    </h3>
    <h4>
   Yog grew to become a top 25 app in the U.S. App Store (Health and Fitness) and at its peak, supported 25,000+ MAU in 103 countries.
