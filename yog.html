    <h3>
      Where we started
    </h3>
    <h4>
      By 2011, running with a phone was familiar. A range of apps offered runners the ability to record and subsequently analyze and socialize through the data they generated during their activities. This was great, assuming you'd already developed a running habit.
    </h4>
    <br><img src="/site/assets/Yog-run-queue.png"><br>
    <h4>
      However, for people who hadn't started running, but wanted to, or for people who wanted to push themselves further, they reported having someone to run <i>with</i> as being most effective at getting them there. Provied you could find someone at your same level, excited to run at the same time, in the same place you were.
    </h4>
    <br><img src="/site/assets/Yog-live-run.png"><br>
    <h4>
      We designed Yog for this purpose: to match runners from around the world to run together virtually, in real time. We paid our attention to creating a distractingly different "in-run" experience, assuming existing trackers had already accommodated for what happened after-the-fact.

    <br><h3>
      Where we ended up
    </h3>
    <h4>
   Yog grew to become a top 25 app in the U.S. App Store (Health and Fitness) and at its peak, supported 25,000+ runners – in 103 countries – running together every month.</h4>
